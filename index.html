    <a>I.</a>
    <p>Just becuase its over,<br>
        doesn't mean it didnt happen.<br>
        Just becuase the love is over,<br>
        doesn't mean you weren't loved.
    </p>

    <a>II.</a>
    <p>A story isn't over until,<br>
        it stops being told.
    </p>

    <a>III.</a>
    <p>Sometimes there is good days,<br>
        and sometimes there is bad days.<br>
        but most of the time,<br>
        the good days have a little bad<br>
        and the bad days have a little good.
    </p>

    <a>IV.</a>
    <p>You can't love someone into loving you.<br>
        Sometimes you just have to wait for the right person<br>
        to love you back.
    </p>

    <a>V.</a>
    <p>Sometimes it's easier to be angry<br>
        than to be sad,<br>
        and I think sometimes<br>
        we forget there is a diffrence.
    </p>

    <a>VI.</a>
    <p>I take hot showers now.<br>
        Not warm, but hot.<br>
        Not because the water feels cold,<br>
        but becuase I want to feel the warmth we used to have.
    </p>

    <a>VII.</a>
    <p>Confidence isn't thinking<br>
        you are better than everyone else.<br>
        It's know you are the best version of yourself.
    </p>

    <a>VIII.</a>
    <p>One person is all it took,<br>
        But one person is also all it takes.
    </p>

    <a>IX.</a>
    <p>Rain is only good when your under the awning.
    </p>

    <a>X.</a>
    <p>Even if you were not here to stay,<br>
        I'm glad your soul stopped by.
    </p>

    <a>XI.</a>
    <p>I soon realise,<br>
        the person I once loved was dead.<br>
        Not becuase you no longer live,<br>
        but because your soul has changed.
    </p>

    <a>XII.</a>
    <p>Your were My first,<br>
        and I don't mean first kiss<br>
        or first relationship<br>
        or first 'I love you'<br>
        <br>
        You were the first person to make me feel.
    </p>

    <a>XIII.</a>
    <p>Feeling are fleeting,<br>
        just surface level,<br>
        but emotions.<br>
        Emotions are deep.<br>
        You never forget them.
    </p>

    <a>XIII.</a>
    <p>Love is a choice.<br>
        It has to be,<br>
        because if love wasn't a choice,<br>
        then you never loved me at all.
    </p>

    <a>XIV.</a>
    <p>I keep going not to prove them wrong,<br>
        not becuase I want to.<br>
        I keep going becuase,<br>
        I deserve one person<br>
        that won't give up on me.
    </p>

    <a>XV.</a>
    <p> I want people to tell me they care.<br>
        I want to know that they are proud of me.<br>
        But I can't bring myself to ask,<br>
        because if the wanted to they would.
    </p>

    <a>XVI.</a>
    <p> I like being alone.<br>
        Thats why I knew it was you,<br>
        becuase in the first time in a long time<br>
        I want someones company more than my own
    </p>

    <a>XVII.</a>
    <p> Last night you asked me why I was sad.<br>
        I told you some times you just are.<br>
        I lied.<br>
        I was sad because I remebered that you didn't love me.<br>

    </p>
    

    <a>XVIII.</a>
    <p> I'm not anyones first choice,<br>
        thats why I have to be my own.
    </p>

    <a>XIX.</a>
    <p> I wish people could feel how I feel,<br>
        the depth,<br>
        the vividness,<br>
        the heavy nights,<br>
        all of it.<br>
        Just so they know how much I feel.
    </p>

    <a>XX.</a>
    <p> People say our time was short.<br>
        They're not wrong,<br>
        it was.<br>
        But thats what was so amazing.<br>
        You made me feel how no one else has every made me feel,<br>
        and just in our short time.
