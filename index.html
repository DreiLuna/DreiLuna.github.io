    <a>I.</a>
    <p>Just because its over,<br>
        doesn't mean it didnt happen.<br>
        Just because the love is over,<br>
        doesn't mean you weren't loved.
    </p>

    <a>II.</a>
    <p>A story isn't over until,<br>
        it stops being told.
    </p>

    <a>III.</a>
    <p>Sometimes there is good days,<br>
        and sometimes there is bad days.<br>
        but most of the time,<br>
        the good days have a little bad<br>
        and the bad days have a little good.
    </p>

    <a>IV.</a>
    <p>You can't love someone into loving you.<br>
        Sometimes you just have to wait for the right person<br>
        to love you back.
    </p>

    <a>V.</a>
    <p>Sometimes it's easier to be angry<br>
        than to be sad,<br>
        and I think sometimes<br>
        we forget there is a diffrence.
    </p>

    <a>VI.</a>
    <p>I take hot showers now.<br>
        Not warm, but hot.<br>
        Not because the water feels cold,<br>
        but because I want to feel the warmth we used to have.
    </p>

    <a>VII.</a>
    <p>Confidence isn't thinking<br>
        you are better than everyone else.<br>
        It's know you are the best version of yourself.
    </p>

    <a>VIII.</a>
    <p>One person is all it took,<br>
        But one person is also all it takes.
    </p>

    <a>IX.</a>
    <p>Rain is only good when your under the awning.
    </p>

    <a>X.</a>
    <p>Even if you were not here to stay,<br>
        I'm glad your soul stopped by.
    </p>

    <a>XI.</a>
    <p>I soon realise,<br>
        the person I once loved was dead.<br>
        Not because you no longer live,<br>
        but because your soul has changed.
    </p>

    <a>XII.</a>
    <p>Your were My first,<br>
        and I don't mean first kiss<br>
        or first relationship<br>
        or first 'I love you'<br>
        <br>
        You were the first person to make me feel.
    </p>

    <a>XIII.</a>
    <p>Feeling are fleeting,<br>
        just surface level,<br>
        but emotions.<br>
        Emotions are deep.<br>
        You never forget them.
    </p>

    <a>XIII.</a>
    <p>Love is a choice.<br>
        It has to be,<br>
        because if love wasn't a choice,<br>
        then you never loved me at all.
    </p>

    <a>XIV.</a>
    <p>I keep going not to prove them wrong,<br>
        not because I want to.<br>
        I keep going because,<br>
        I deserve one person<br>
        that won't give up on me.
    </p>

    <a>XV.</a>
    <p> I want people to tell me they care.<br>
        I want to know that they are proud of me.<br>
        But I can't bring myself to ask,<br>
        because if they did I shouldn't have to ask.
    </p>

    <a>XVI.</a>
    <p> I like being alone.<br>
        Thats why I knew it was you,<br>
        because in the first time in a long time<br>
        I want someones company more than my own
    </p>

    <a>XVII.</a>
    <p> Last night you asked me why I was sad.<br>
        I told you some times you just are.<br>
        I lied.<br>
        I was sad because I remebered that you didn't love me.<br>
        <b>12/3/23</b>
    </p>
    

    <a>XVIII.</a>
    <p> I'm not anyones first choice,<br>
        thats why I have to be my own.
    </p>

    <a>XIX.</a>
    <p> I wish people could feel how I feel,<br>
        the depth,<br>
        the vividness,<br>
        the heavy nights,<br>
        all of it.<br>
        Just so they know how much I feel.
    </p>

    <a>XX.</a>
    <p> People say our time was short.<br>
        They're not wrong,<br>
        it was.<br>
        But thats what was so amazing.<br>
        You made me feel how no one else has every made me feel,<br>
        and just in our short time.
    </p>
    <a>XXI.</a>
    <p> Your life isn't falling apart.<br>
        its falling into place.

    <p>
        I'm not doing to die when we hear it.<br>
        I won't die the next day,<br>
        or the day after that,<br>
        or the day after that.<br>
        So today,<br>
        right now,<br>
        well this is a wonderful day.
    </p>

    <a>XXV.</a>
    <p>
        You can never know how much that glimpse of you made my day,<br>
        reminding me of what life is all about.

    <p>
        They gave me the gift of being a presence in their lives.
    </p>

    <a>XXVII.</a>
    <p>
        Look, I'm going to find a way to be happy,<br>
        and I'd really love to be happy with you,<br>
        but if I can't be happy with you,<br>
        then I'll find a way to be happy without you.
    </p>

    <a>XXIX.</a>
    <p>
        Brick walls are there for a reason.<br>
        They give us a chance to show how badly we want something.
    </p>
    <a>XXX.</a>
    <p>
        No matter how bad things are you can always make things worse.<br>
        At the same time,<br>
        it is often within your power to make them better.
    </p>
    <a>XXXI.</a>
    <p>
        We discuss,<br>
        we get frustrated,<br>
        we get mad,<br>
        we make up.
    </p>
    <a>XXXII.</a>
    <p>
        It's not helpful if we spend ever day dreading tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
        The apprentice tells the toymaker that he can't die;<br>
        he has to live.<br>
        And he responds: <br>
        'I already did that.'
    </p>
    <a>XXXIV.</a>
    <p>
        I'll try harder.<br>
        It's one of my New Years resolutions.
    </p>
    <a>XXXV.</a>
    <p>
        So I left the store,<br>
        happier to have fifteen minutes than sixteen dollars
    </p>

    <a>XXXVII.</a>
    <p>

        I'm living like I'm dying.<br>

    <br>
    <hr>

    <a>I.</a>
    <p>

        Why do I worry about the fish,<br>
        when there are is so much of the ocean to explore.
    </p>

    <a>II.</a>
    <p>
        What would it be like if you didn't hold back.<br>
        What would it be like if you shared your entire self with the world.<br>
        What would it be like if you moved through the fear.
    </p>

    <a>III.</a>
    <p>
        All she really needed was to be free.
    </p>

    <a>IV.</a>
    <p>
        when we stop running to catch the train of existence,<br>
        the train of life shows up right on time.
    </p>
    
    
    <a>V.</a>
    <p>
        Knowing that one day we will no longer be<br>
        kids,<br>
        teens,<br>
        adults,<br>
        and eventually<br>
        no longer living<br>
        is what makes the moments and memories<br>
        so much more special than any other <br>
        indefinite illusion.
